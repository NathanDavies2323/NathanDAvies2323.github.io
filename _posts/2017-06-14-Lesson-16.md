    <td>Today, me and my partner found someone who is at a similar level to us so we have now formed a three. We started off the lesson by helping each other get to the same point. This only took five minutes. We then progressed as a three and gave each other small hints just to guide each other in the correct direction. We completed a lot of the work this lesson.</td>
