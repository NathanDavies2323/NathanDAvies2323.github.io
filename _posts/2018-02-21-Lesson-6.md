**Lesson 6**

In the lesson today, we stopped using our virtual shop and spent more time on our decoder. We didn't do as caesar shift though. We learnt about binary and ascii code. We made a decoder that decoded Binary. I found this task very challenging as we had to work out binary and dec and letters. This confused me to begin with but by the end of the lesson, I understood binary. To finish off the lesson, we used binary to spell out 'hello worldâ€™. We did this in many different boxes and used three rows to solve the problem. This was a very challenging lesson but fun overall!
