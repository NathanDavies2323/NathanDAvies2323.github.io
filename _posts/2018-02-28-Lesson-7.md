Lesson 7

In today's lesson we carried on with our Ascii code and learnt more about the different functions of different computers. As we will soon be switching teacher to a teacher where we learn more about coding rather than the excel side of things. In todayâ€™s lesson we pretty much got an introduction to coding. Our teacher taught us all about why coding is useful, different types of coding and how a coding chain reaction is formed. I am looking forward to our new teacher and learning all about coding next lesson!
