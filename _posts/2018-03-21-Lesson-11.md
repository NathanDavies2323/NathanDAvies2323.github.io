Lesson 11

In today's lesson, we went back to the good old python with turtle. It was much better this way as we are easily able to code our names. However, we have been set a project where we will have to code our own first name in 3D. This is going to be a very long task but it certainly won’t be boring! Below, you will see a screenshot attached. It will have the coding for the 3D 'N’ on the left and the 3D ‘N’ on the right. This code took a lot of time as it is a rather difficult task. However, it is not impossible, it is just a fun challenge. Overall, I have enjoyed today’s lesson and am looking forward to the rest of this project as I’m sure it will be fun!
