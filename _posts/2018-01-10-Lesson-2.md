Lesson Two

In today's lesson, we started by all logging on as usual and we set up google sheets. Then we crowded around the teacher and listened to what he was saying. We spent most of the lesson doing this and trying things out. I found this a relatively simple task. We also did something where we had to have a box at the bottom that showed you how many items you had bought. The final task, which I have yet to work out, was to make a box which gives you a discount depending on how many different items you buy. My lesson review of today was that it went fairly well I just need to work out the discount box.
