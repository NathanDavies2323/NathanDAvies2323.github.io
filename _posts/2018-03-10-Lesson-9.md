**Lesson 9**

In today's lesson, we carried on working on repl.it. However, instead of coding a shape, we coded a questionnaire where we asked a question. For homework, we had to add an extra three questions. Below I have attached a screenshot of my repl.it questionnaire. In today’s lesson, we started off by looking at each other’s work and walking around the classroom to see what others have done at home. I am currently finding IT very fun and easy. I hope this continues!
