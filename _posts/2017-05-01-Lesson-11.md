    <td>We have just come back from a two week holiday and have changed teachers so we are now doing something different than coding out of  booklet. We are now going on codecademy and completing courses which will strengthen our coding.</td>

    <td>We are doing this in pairs and I quite often have to wait for my partner so that is definitely slowing me down!</td>

    <td>Next time, I will try and come up with an easier way to help my partner learn. I definitely think that my ability to translate the instructions into code will need some polishing!</td>
