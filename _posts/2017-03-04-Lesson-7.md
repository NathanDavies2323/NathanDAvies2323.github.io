Today I messed up.

    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>In today's lesson, I did a major muck up!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete more of the coding booklet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Not really.
</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We started off completing loads of work at such a high speed it was possible for us to get onto the wiring. It was all good until the end of the lesson. At the end of the lesson was when I majorly messed up!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><h2>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I did really well and we were coding really well. I only think that I should try not to delete that lesson's work next time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><h2>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will definitely not delete my work. Apart from that, I am pleased with the amount that I would have produced. I canâ€™t really say much else about this lesson though.</td>
