  <tr>
    <td>In today's lesson, we coded about six levels. This is only because one of the levels took ages to complete and after about forty minutes of work, I realised that this whole time, I had missed out a colon. Apart from this, our lesson went fairly well today.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><h2>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that limited my learning today was the colon.</td>

  <tr>
  <td><h2>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will make sure I have read through my code thoroughly and check for any missing punctuation.</td>
  </tr>
