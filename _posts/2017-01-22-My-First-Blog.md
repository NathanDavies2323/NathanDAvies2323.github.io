10/01/17 and 17/1/17

In this lesson we started coding and created our website.


<p><b>Target for these lessons?</b> To have a Github site up and running. To start coding onto my pen drive.</p>


<p><b>Did I reach my targets?</b> Yes.</p>

    <td>We were all given a manual telling us how we're supposed to publish our blogs and get our website onto the internet. I kept on reading it through before doing the next step as it was only a few pages. When I had read through it, all I had to do was start blogging! I really don’t think that we had work that was too hard, but I wouldn't call it easy! We had to do a fair bit of coding to get our backgrounds and colours working. I think I will always make sure I check my work after I have completed the task in hand. We were also all told how to set up our stations ready for the robot arm coding later this year. We were all told how to work through our manual and off we started. Once our coding was decent and we had finished this lesson, we saved our lesson's progress onto our pen drives ready for next lesson.</td>

    <td>I don’t really think that there was much area for improvement as I have still got my website running. I think that I could work on my ability to write code myself instead of filling in the area needed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I blog, I will make sure that I produce more in the lesson as then I get less homework. I will also try to keep all of my repositories tidy. Overall, I don’t think that there is much that I could improve on.</td>
