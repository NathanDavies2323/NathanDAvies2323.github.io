Lesson 12

In today's lesson, we started by sitting down expecting another lesson of coding, but we actually didn’t we did a few buzzfeed quizzes and then discussed what we noticed. We talked about the positives and the negatives of these quizzes, for example, a positive was that it was fun and we learnt from it. On the other hand, a negative was that I did a quiz on sports cars and it asked me random questions like which type of restaurant is my favourite. These questions have nothing to do with cars and then at the end of the quiz, it showed me different pictures of cars and asked which was my favourite. We discussed how we could improve from this and then went off to make our own quizzes. We haven’t yet made the actual quiz, we have just done a plan of it and decided how our scoring system would work. My quiz is on how long you would last in a zombie apocalypse. This is what I have done so far:
