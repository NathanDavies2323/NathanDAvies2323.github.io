Lesson 14

In today's lesson we spent about three quarters of it looking at the board and seeing what the teacher needed to show us. Then, we had to go back to our seats and fill in the rest of our quiz. This was more than easy for me as I had already done it but other people needed help too, so I spent the last 15 minutes of the lesson helping others. This lesson didn’t help me as much but I did get to help others! Helping others would have helped my coding ability as it helped me see other people’s quizzes and spot problems in their code.
