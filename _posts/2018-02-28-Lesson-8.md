Lesson 8

Today we met our new teacher and had our first lesson with him. We are learning how to use python and what it is. Today, we started using a website called 'repl.it' and when we went in it, we used python3 turtle. This was a very fun lesson as we coded our computer to draw a shape. From then on, we learnt how to make multiple shapes and their patterns. For homework, we were told we had to make a funky shape or pattern and we will show it to our class next lesson. Below is a screenshot of what I have done for my homework. On the left is my code and on the right is what the turtle I have coded is drawing. I have made this shape by coding my turtle to create many different triangles and shifting them 7 pixels each way. I have also coded the colour that the turtle is drawing from black so it looks nicer. Today was a great lesson, I canâ€™t wait for next week!
