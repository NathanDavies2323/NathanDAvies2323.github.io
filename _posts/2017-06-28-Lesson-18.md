    <td>In today's lesson, I completed a lot of coding. I only completed six levels / stages today but one of them was fifty-three lines long. To complete this one, I worked with my friends and we helped each other. This took up about half of the lesson and resulted in us feeling a sense of accomplishment.</td>
