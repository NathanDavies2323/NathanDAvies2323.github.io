    <td>In this lesson I didn't do much different apart from becoming extremely confident and reading the book to my partner, we didn’t do much different to all the other lessons. The faster I finish the booklet though, the faster I can become confident and try new things out. I am excited for the robot arm as by then, I will be quite a lot more confident.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, we switched roles and I let my partner do the coding but I think we progressed more when I did. I think I need to work on the speed I code. Apart from that, we had a fairly successful lesson.</td>

  <tr>
  <td><h2>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</h2></td>

  <tr>
    <td>I don’t really think I could improve much apart from learning to convert files onto my pen drive faster.</td>
