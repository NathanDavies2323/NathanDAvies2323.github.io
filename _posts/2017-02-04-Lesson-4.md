    <td>In this lesson today, I did a lot more coding than usual because my partner wasn't here. The first bit of coding that I did was called Girls and Boys. The second set of coding was called Apples and Cakes. For both sets of coding, I kept on trying different things and saw what worked and what didn’t. This way, I will be a stronger coder and I will be able to code more confidently knowing what works and what doesn’t. I will definitely keep trying things like that in the future.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I don’t really think much limited my learning. I actually found it easier without my partner as I could just glance between the booklet and my monitor. I also found that i made less mistakes. I think that this is probably because I often got confused with what my partner was saying.</td>

    <td>Next time, I will for sure try to see what coding works by testing the booklet. I will also try to improve my learning by maybe going</td>
