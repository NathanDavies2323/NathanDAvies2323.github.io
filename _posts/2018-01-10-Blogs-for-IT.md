Blogs For IT

Lesson One

In today's lesson, we first got introduced to our teacher who will be teaching us for the rest of the year. After this, we watched our teacher create a shop on spreadsheets where it automatically added up the prices and 	told you how much everything would cost put together. While watching our teacher do this, we took notes down and then created it our self using 'vlookup'.
