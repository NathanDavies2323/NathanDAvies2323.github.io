    <td>Yesterday was a very successful lesson, this was because we just went in head down and coded. I am very pleased with the progress that we made as I improved so much! We definitely completed a lot more than last lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning last lesson, was the fact that we were not able to complete one exercise. We were stuck on it for nearly 20 minutes and that definitely hindered the rate in which we worked at.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time ,if I get stuck, I will almost definitely ask for help from a friend after I have tried everything I can. Other than that, this has been an extremely successful lesson.</td>
