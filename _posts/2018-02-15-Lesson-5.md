Lesson 5

Today was the final lesson before the holiday. We just improved our spreadsheets and had a friendly chat while doing so. We focused on the work while chatting so we got a lot done. We improved the efficiency of our shop for the first half of the lesson but then changed to a more fun activity for the second half of the lesson. For this final stretch of IT, we worked out a caesar shift and tried without any help from the teacher to create a coder. My friend and I worked out how to much faster than the rest of the class so our teacher told us to try and create a decoder. He put up a message on the board and we had to use our decoder to decode it. The message read 'Hello World'.
