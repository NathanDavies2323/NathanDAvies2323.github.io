    <td>This year, I have learnt a lot. First of all, I have learnt how to make my blog look better and how to use different tools. For example, I have learnt how to use Codecademy and made a lot of progress in it. I have also learnt skills from the range of videos that my teacher has shown me.</td>

    <td>This year, there was only a few small little things that limited my learning. They were just missing half of a lesson because of a doctor's appointment or something like that. </td>
