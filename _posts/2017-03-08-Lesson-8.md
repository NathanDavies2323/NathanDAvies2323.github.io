  <td><h2>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson was very much more successful compared to the last. We did at least twice the amount of work that we have ever done in one lesson in this one. We even completed the work that I deleted last week. This lesson we even completed one of the tasks to build on the wires.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><h2>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There was a little confusion of the wires to start with but then we did well. I think what may have limited my learning was the fact that I deleted last week's work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><h2>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve my learning by trying to understand the wires a bit better.
Here is a video showing what we did on the wires:
