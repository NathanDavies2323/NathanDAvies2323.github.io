Lesson 13

In the lesson today, we all crowded around the board so we can see what the objective of the lesson was.Today, we had to turn our Google Docs Quiz Plan into an actual quiz. We are supposed to get the input in so as we can work on it next lesson. I have done the homework, so all of my quiz can actually quiz. My quiz is on a zombie apocalypse and the objective is to see how long you would last in one. This is my working quiz:
