  <td><h2>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Today wasn't any special lesson. We just did more coding. I am now just under 50% and at the top of our class. However, I am impressed with the performance I put into coding today. The amount of code I put into codecademy today was really quite a lot.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><h2>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Toda, nothing really limited my learning, I put in a lot of effort and came out with a lot of code. If anything limited my learning it would be the talk we had at the start about the phrase 'CBA’. This only stopped five minutes of coding so it didn’t really change much.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><h2>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will do the same as I did this lesson.</td>
