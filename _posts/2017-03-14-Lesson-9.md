    <td>Today we did a lot of coding but mainly wiring. We came up with a clever idea of me doing the wiring while my friend does all the coding. This was a very good idea as we did so much work as a result. </td>

    <td>This lesson, the wires were a bit fiddly to start with but I got the hang of them as we progressed.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to get used to the wires faster but this lesson was possibly the best IT I have had. This is because we progressed so well.</td>
