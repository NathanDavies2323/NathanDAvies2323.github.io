**Lesson 4**

In today's lesson, we started to create a completely different sheet. This sheet had stock and animals sold. The sheet I created showed me the stock I have left, the cost of certain things like advertising or paying employees. It subtracts the tax and what I bought the animals for from my total. My spreadsheet then totalled up everything and found out how much profit/loss I had gained/lost that year/month/week. Below, I will attach a screenshot of my second shop.

Here is a screenshot of my second shop:
