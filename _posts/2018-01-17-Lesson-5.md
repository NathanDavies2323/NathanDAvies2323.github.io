In today's lesson, we did revision of our Shop. We started off with our teacher asking us how to do things and we would answer. It was like a quiz, we would answer the questions he asks us. Later on in the lesson, we went back and just tried new things out. As well as this, we also recapped the things we may have forgotten like the vlookup. Overall, I think today was a challenging lesson where we helped ourselves remember how to do the things we forgot.
